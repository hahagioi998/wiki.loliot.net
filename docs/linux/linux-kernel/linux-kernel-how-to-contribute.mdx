If all amlogic SoC has same register style, I think the code below is fine.

static const unsigned int meson_bit_strides[] = {
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
};

static void meson_calc_reg_and_bit(struct meson_bank *bank, unsigned int pin,
enum meson_reg_type reg_type,
unsigned int *reg, unsigned int *bit)
{
struct meson_reg_desc *desc = &bank->regs[reg_type];

        *bit = (desc->bit + pin - bank->first) << meson_bit_strides[reg_type];
        *reg = (desc->reg + (*bit / 32)) * 4;
        *bit &= 0x1f;

}

How about this?
